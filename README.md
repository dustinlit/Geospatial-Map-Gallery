# Geospatial-Map-Gallery
*By Dustin Littlefield*

Welcome to my portfolio of cartographic and geospatial analysis projects. This collection showcases thematic maps, spatial modeling, and data visualizations built using GIS tools and remote sensing techniques.

I recently graduated **summa cum laude** with a B.S. in Data Science and a Certificate in GIS from **Arizona State University**, and I am transitioning from a 15-year career as a medical lab technician to the geospatial field.

## About This Portfolio

This repository contains a curated set of maps created for coursework, capstone projects, and independent study. The maps demonstrate:

- Spatial data visualization
- Cartographic design principles
- Environmental and urban planning analysis
- Interpolation and terrain modeling
- Public health and transportation applications
